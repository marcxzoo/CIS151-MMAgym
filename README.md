This site started as a traditional multi‑page static website and was later migrated into a Vite project so I could use a modern dev workflow. 
That change created path and build issues when deploying to GitHub Pages (especially with multiple HTML files and assets), and the live version is not yet fully functional. 
For the course deadline this repo mainly serves as a record of my attempt; 
given more time, I plan to either rebuild the project from scratch with a cleaner structure or learn more Git and Vite to fix the deployment properly.
